A navigational aid viewer, map generator, and flight planner for Microsoft Flight Simulator:

I wrote the first version of Nav in 1995, and had several releases over the next 8 or so years. I used several different source code revision control systems back then, but I no longer have access to them. The is the source code for the Nav 3.0 release circa year 2000. Code changes for version 3.1 are lost for now.
